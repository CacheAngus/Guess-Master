object oriented programming-uses classes/objects that it surrounds, i.e. public, private class
also involves methods and data
basic java
-applet: its meant to be run from a web browser, cannot be provided by html eg captures mouse input and also have controls like buttons and checking boxes, moble borowsers dont run them tho

public classs BankAccount {
		private String Owner;
		private int account;




		public void deposit (double amount){}

		public static void main(String[] args){

			System.out.printIn("Hellow World! \nHello Customer :) !"); <- call the object name . function them matter e.e Math.min
			System.out.printf(This ismy day %d", 2);
		}
}

everything is defined by .java
each class is compiled wwith javac 

running class contains the main method

public static void main(String[] args)

byte-code does a two step way to translate it into machine language (ege bankaccount.class) its a machine language for a java virtual machine
	its first translate by an interpreter and executes each byte-code instruction one after another, this is usually done by a set of instructions

Syntax and Sematics:
	
	identifier: the name of a variable or other item defined in a program
	predefined identifiers in libraries requred by java language standard-public system, string, printIn
